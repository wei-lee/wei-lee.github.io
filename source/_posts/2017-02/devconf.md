At this year's [DevConf](https://devconf.cz/) in Brno, Czech Republic, I gave a talk titled "Microservices: Lessons Learned".

These lessons are based on the real-world experience we had when try to move our platform from monolith to microservices. I hope you will find them useful.

Here are the slides:

There is a [video](https://youtu.be/c0n8LcszVdM) as well if you want to watch it.

Thanks and enjoy!
